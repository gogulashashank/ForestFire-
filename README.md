# ForestFire-
Develop predictive models that will identify whether a forest fire will happen.

Project Overview

The national forestry commission has asked you to build a machine learning model capable of classifying forests as either "fire likely" (1) or "fire unlikely" (0) in a particular time window based on details about the forest and surrounding land and air. The goal is to develop predictive models that will identify whether a forest fire will happen.
Dataset

The dataset for this project is provided in the file forestdata.csv. A data dictionary describing the features in the dataset is also provided.
Tasks

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA on the dataset to understand the distribution of the features, identify any missing values, and explore the relationships between the features and the target variable.

Feature Engineering: Based on your understanding of the problem and the dataset, create any additional features that might be useful for the predictive models.

Model Development:
        Logistic Regression: Develop a logistic regression model to predict whether a forest fire is likely or unlikely.
        Decision Tree: Develop a decision tree model to predict whether a forest fire is likely or unlikely.
        Neural Network: Develop a neural network model to predict whether a forest fire is likely or unlikely.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the three models using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Confusion Matrix: Plot the confusion matrix for each of the three models to visualize their performance.

Model Comparison: Compare the performance of the three models and determine the best-performing model for the given problem.
